  "The browser side of the Kernel contract: the only API viewers use to talk to a
  compiled function.

  Every kernel, whichever backend compiled it, is a JS function callable in
  Emmy's calling convention that also carries:

  - `batch(xs, n, ps, out)`: evaluates `n` points (their flattened states,
    row-major in `xs`) and returns the outputs, row-major, in a Float64Array;
  - `ready()`: whether the kernel can evaluate yet (an asynchronously compiled
    module is not ready at first);
  - `dims`: `{state, outputs, params}`.

  Viewers call these functions instead of the properties, so a backend can
  change how it meets the contract without any viewer changing.")
